# Rice Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying different types of rice grains using machine learning techniques. Developed on Google Colab as part of a final high school computer science project (10 units), it demonstrates supervised learning and model evaluation techniques on real-world agricultural data.

## Project Overview

The goal is to accurately classify rice types based on physical characteristics using a machine learning model. The project includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling and splitting
- Model training (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, or Random Forest)
- Accuracy evaluation
- Confusion matrix visualization

## Dataset

The dataset includes labeled rice samples with features such as:

- Area
- Perimeter
- Compactness
- Kernel length
- Kernel width
- Asymmetry coefficient
- Groove length

Each row is labeled with the rice variety (e.g., **Jasmine**, **Basmati**, etc.).

2. Upload the rice dataset (`rice_dataset.csv`).
3. Run all cells from top to bottom:
   - Install/import libraries
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Preprocess data
   - Train and evaluate models
4. View model performance and visualizations.

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **96%**, showing high effectiveness in classifying rice types based on their physical attributes.
